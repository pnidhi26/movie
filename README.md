# Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis using machine learning

Implemented text analysis using machine learning models to classification of sentiments from movie reviews given by cinema users as positive or negative.

# Tuned CountVectorizer (1_gram) to get appropriate features/tokens and then transformed to obtain input variable (document term matrix).

# Splitted training test with test size of 20%
# Used the following models to train on training data.
    - Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
    - KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
    
# The results are in tested models accuracy of prediction:
    - Naive Bayes: 98.9161849711%
    - Logistic Regression: 99.3497109827%
    - SVM: 99.0606936416%
    - KNN: 98.6994219653%
